# Preprogrammed maneuver file for open loop maneuvers

# DEFLECTION TYPE

# 2=relative - Deflection values added to the last commanded values when
#              the autopilot was activated.
# 3=superimposed - Pilot retains manual control, but the deflection values 
#                  are superimposed on top on current input.

# CONTROL INPUTS
# For open loop maneuvers, the control inputs will be given in MxN format where
# M is the number of points in time for which an input is specified and N is the
# number of different independent inputs. After all inputs have been specified,
# the word 'END' is placed on the following line to signal the end of input
# sequence. The columns labeled as follows:
