#Preprogrammed maneuver file
#
#General format for file is:
#'Variable'
#<value value value>

#Initial condition type*
#1=current flight conditions
#2=specified condition
IC_TYPE
1

#Time (sec) that states are changed
TIME
3 4 5 6

#Pitch angle (deg)
THETA
30 30 30 30

#Roll angle (deg)
PHI
0 0 0 0

#Velocity (ft/s)**
VEL
-1

#Throttle (%)**
THR
0 0 0 0



#*IC_TYPE=1 does not require user to enter TIME=0 states
#IC_TYPE=2 requires user to enter states at TIME=0, aircraft will start maneuver once it has reached the initial conditions, which will be considered TIME=0
#**Specify either VEL or THR, not both. Set other one to -1
